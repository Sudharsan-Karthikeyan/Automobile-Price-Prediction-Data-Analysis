Title: Automobile Price Prediction & Data Analysis

Description:
A Python-based project performing end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to estimate automobile prices. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression models to identify key factors influencing vehicle prices. Visualizations provide insights into trends and correlations.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns in the dataset.

Regression Modeling: Built Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models. Evaluated performance using RMSE and R² metrics.

Feature Engineering: Created derived features to improve prediction accuracy.

Data Visualization: Used matplotlib and seaborn to generate actionable insights.

Technologies & Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

Outcome:
Accurate predictive models for automobile prices with interpretable insights on key features such as engine specs, mileage, fuel type, and body style.
